## Overview

Impact Visualizer is a web-based simulation that demonstrates asteroid deflection strategies in both 3D and 2D. Users can interact with satellites to deflect incoming asteroids using methods such as **Kinetic Impactor** and **Gravity Tractor**, and visualize the effects in real-time.

## Features

- **3D Simulation** using React Three Fiber & Rapier Physics
- **Gravity Tractor & Kinetic Impactor** mechanics
- **2D Map Visualization** using Leaflet
- Real-time satellite controls with keyboard
- Success/Failure messages based on asteroid trajectory
- Interactive and visually immersive experience

### Keyboard Controls (Live Demo)

- **W:** Move forward
- **S:** Move backward
- **A:** Move left
- **D:** Move right
- **E:** Move up
- **Q:** Move down

### Modes

- **Kinetic Impactor:** Launch a satellite to collide with the asteroid and deflect it.
- **Gravity Tractor:** Use a satellite to pull the asteroid gradually away from its path.
- **Coming Soon:** Nuclear Explosion mode
